In Windows Powershell:
----------------------------
1. Open Windows Powershell and run "Get-ExecutionPolicy -List".

2. We have to make the LocalMachine ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted. 

3. To do so, run the command "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted" and type Y to confirm the changes.

4. Run the command 'Get-ExecutionPolicy -List' to see the changes done.


In Visual Studio Code:
---------------------------
1. Run "tsc filename.ts"

2. This generates the 'compiled' file of the same file in ".js" format in the same location.

3. Run the .js file as you normally do: "node filename.js"
